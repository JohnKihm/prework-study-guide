        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a programming language used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash /</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, etc. elements represent the level of heading for a given text block i.e. larger more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items i.e. bulleted or numbered lists and the items on those lists.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used directly in the HTML file to apply styles to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Inline styles are useful for quick and permanant changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage using a style element in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>An external style sheet contains CSS rules in a separate file that is linked to the HTML file with a link element in the head section.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep tack of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of code that can be worked on independently to avoid disrupting other team members also working on the code.</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch into the base branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add [file] or git add -A: add a single file or all files to the next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[message]": commit staged content with a message describing changes made</li>
          <li>git push [alias] [branch]: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch (GitHub)</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JS files can be linked to an HTML file with a script element in the body section.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript code runs from top to bottom unless interrupted by conditional statements or loops.</li>
          <li>Code contained within an if statement will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>Code contained within a loop statement will execute over and over until the loop's condition is no longer true.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements: first the starting point for the loop, the condition that tells it when to stop, and the final statement that tells it how to iterate.</li>
